# DSA Practice Sheet

This **DSA Sheet** is a structured and curated collection of essential **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems designed to enhance problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews by covering all essential topics in a well-structured, topic-wise format. The problems are primarily sourced from platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) & [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).
Each problem is primarily solved in **Java** and organized into folders based on **topics** for easy and efficient navigation.

## Structure

The repository is organized under a main folder named DSA Sheet, which contains two key subfolders:
1. `gfg/`
   Contains coding problems from GeeksforGeeks
     
   - `gfg/gfg100/`: [GeeksforGeeks 150](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-100-data-structure-and-algorithms-dsa-interview-questions-topic-wise/)
   
2. `leetcode`
   Contains coding problems from LeetCode

   - `leetcode/leetcode75`: [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/)
   - `leetcode/top-interview-150`: [Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/)

## File Naming Convention

- **LeetCode Problems**
  Files are named by the question number, e.g., `1313.java`, corresponding to the LeetCode problem number.

- **GeeksforGeeks Problems**
  Files are named based on the problem name for clarity, e.g., `Word-Search.java`.

## Format

Each problem entry (to be tracked in the README) includes the following:

- **Question**: Problem title
- **Difficulty**: Easy / Medium / Hard
  > The focus is primarily on **Easy** and **Medium** problems to build strong foundational skills. Hard problems are included selectively.
- **Problem Link**: Direct link to the question (LeetCode, GFG, etc.)
- **Solution Link**: Link to the implemented Java solution in the repository (to be updated as solutions are added)
