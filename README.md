# DSA Practice Sheet

This **DSA Sheet** is a structured and curated collection of essential **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems designed to enhance problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews by covering all essential topics in a well-structured, topic-wise format. The problems are primarily sourced from platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) etc, with a special focus on interview questions asked by Zoho.

Each problem is primarily solved in **Java** and organized into folders based on **topics** for easy and efficient navigation.

## Structure

The repository is organized under a main folder named DSA Sheet, which contains two key subfolders:
1. `zoho/`
   Contains coding problems specifically asked in **[Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/)** interviews. These are further categorized by the source platform:
   
   - `zoho/leetcode/`: [LeetCode questions asked in Zoho interviews](https://leetcode.com/company/zoho/)
     
   - `zoho/gfg/`: [GeeksforGeeks problems asked in Zoho interviews](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&company=Zoho)
     
2. `leetcode75/`
   
   Contains the curated **[LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/)** questions, aimed at mastering core concepts across arrays, linked lists, trees, and more.

## File Naming Convention

- **LeetCode problems** (especially in `leetcode75/` and `zoho/leetcode/`):
  Files are named by the question number, e.g., `1313.java`, corresponding to the LeetCode problem number.

- **Non-LeetCode** problems (e.g., from GFG, inside `zoho/gfg/`):
  Files are named based on the problem name for clarity, e.g., `4Sum.java`.

## Format

Each problem entry (to be tracked in a separate README or spreadsheet if applicable) includes the following:

- **Question**: Problem title
- **Difficulty**: Easy / Medium / Hard
  > The focus is primarily on **Easy** and **Medium** problems to build strong foundational skills. Hard problems are included selectively.
- **Problem Link**: Direct link to the question (LeetCode, GFG, etc.)
- **Solution Link**: Link to the implemented Java solution in the repository (to be updated as solutions are added)
